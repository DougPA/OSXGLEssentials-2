This project creates a simple Triangle using OpenGL 3.2 and simple Vertex and Fragment shader programs.

OSXGLEssentials-3 is the same example constructed using GLKit & GLKBaseEffect instead of Vertex & Fragment shaders

It is a much simplified version of the Apple Example Code - GLEssentials

It is only applicable to Mac OS X

It was built using XCode 5 DP running on OS X 10.8.4 (it seems to work on OS X Mavericks, 10.9 DP-6 as well)
